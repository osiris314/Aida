Welcome to my project weirdly smart humans. this project is about home automation, and how it can help us in everyday life scenarios.WARNING this is not for making our life easier for simple tasks we are bored to do.
it is currently running on a Raspberry pi 3, in cooperation with the father of DIY projects Arduino.

so any way enjoy the project and fill free to send me your ideas!
